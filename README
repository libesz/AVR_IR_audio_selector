This is a little AVR project which is an audio selector application, based on my InfraRed reciever library
 (You can select the audio channel by buttons as well of course).

Parts:
-TSOP31233 IR reciever
-ATmega8
-UDN2981
-6 relays for the quality
-RCA connectors

The IR library was designed to be portable, so you can use it for other purposes easily ( I hope :) ).
